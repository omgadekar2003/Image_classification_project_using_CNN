# Image_classification_project_using_CNN
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model was trained on a dataset of 25,000 images, performing essential tasks such as data preprocessing, augmentation, and model implementation.
