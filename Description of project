Description:

Project Description:
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model was trained on a dataset of 25,000 images, performing essential tasks such as data preprocessing, augmentation, and model implementation.

Key Features of the Project:

Data Preprocessing: Applied various image transformations and augmentations to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
CNN Implementation: The CNN model was responsible for feature extraction from images, capturing intricate patterns that distinguish cats from dogs.
ANN Implementation: The ANN model handled classification, leveraging the extracted features to make predictions.
Performance Metrics: The model achieved impressive classification accuracy, demonstrating the power of deep learning in handling complex image-based tasks.
Challenges:
One of the main challenges I faced was the time-consuming nature of image processing and model training, as deep learning models require substantial computational resources and training time on large datasets. Despite this, the model successfully delivered robust and accurate results.

This project enhanced my skills in deep learning, model development, and provided deeper insights into real-world applications of machine learning for image classification tasks.
